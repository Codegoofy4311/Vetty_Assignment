# Vetty_Assignment
In this assignment, I created the two tables shown in the dataset transactions and items and filled them with the sample data provided. After setting up the tables, I wrote SQL queries to answer all eight questions. These include counting monthly purchases, checking which stores had many orders in October, calculating how fast refunds happened, finding each store’s first order value, seeing which item people bought first most often, marking which refunds can be accepted, and finding the second purchase made by each buyer.

My approach was to understand each question in simple terms, break it into smaller steps, and then write SQL queries that clearly follow those steps. I used filtering, grouping, ordering, time calculations, and ranking to get the answers. I also added easy-to-read comments so anyone can understand what each query is doing. This project shows my ability to work with data, think logically, and use SQL to answer real business questions from a database.
