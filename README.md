# Vetty_Assignment
In this assignment, I created the two tables shown in the dataset transactions and items and filled them with the sample data provided. After setting up the data, I wrote SQL queries to answer all eight questions. These include counting monthly purchases, checking which stores had many orders in October, calculating how fast refunds happened, finding each store’s first order value, seeing which item people bought first most often, marking which refunds can be accepted, and finding the second purchase made by each buyer. I also wrote clear comments so anyone can easily understand what each query does. This project shows my ability to work with data, use SQL properly, and answer business-related questions from a database.
